# Format definition:
#
# 1. 'name':
# Name of the locale.
# Should contain only symbols, suitable for C identifier plus '-'.
# Required parameter.
#
# 2. 'alpha', 'lower', 'upper', 'digit', 'xdigit', 'space',
# 'blank', 'print', 'graph', 'cntrl', 'punct':
#
# List(sequence) of tests for corresponded class. Character is assumed
# to be included into the class if it passes at least one test.
#
# Each test may be:
#
#  1) a single character. Test passes only for given character.
#  2) a sequence of two characters, denoted the first and the last character
#     in a range. Test passes only for characters in given range.
#  3) name of another class. Test passes for all characters in given class.
#  4) mapping with a single key NOT and a subtest as a value.
#     Test passes only if subtest is failed.
#  5) mapping with a single key AND and a sequence of subtests as a value.
#     Test passes only if all subtests pass.
#
# If parameter is absent, none symbol is assumed to be classified such.
#
# 3. 'tolower', 'toupper'
#
# List of conversions from to lower case and upper case correspondignly.
# Each conversion should be a triple(sequence of 3 elements):
#
# [first character in range, last character in range, first converted character].
#
# Conversion is applicable for all characters in given range and performed as
#
#    c => first_converted_character + (c - first_character_in_range).
#
# If none conversion is applicable for given symbol (or corresponded
# parameter is absent), than the symbol is mapped to itself.
